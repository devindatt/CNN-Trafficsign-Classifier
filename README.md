# Udacity Traffic Sign Detector

## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Neural Network

Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree

Overview

In this project, I will use deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. The objective is to train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the German Traffic Sign Dataset. After the model is trained, I will test it out on images of German traffic signs that I found find on the web.

Included with this code is a detailed writeup of this project. 

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report
* Dependencies

Dataset and Repository

Download the data set in a pickled file where:

* all the images are already resized to 32x32 pixels
* It contains a training, validation and test set
